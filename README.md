# Jetpack

## Overview

Jetpack is a game like Jetpack Joyride but with a twist, it can be played with two **simultaneous players!**

## Technical Documentation

Detailed specifications for the underlying systems are available in the doc.txt file.

*   **Network Protocol:** Defines how clients and the server communicate.
*   **Map Format:** Specifies the structure for creating custom game levels.

## API Documentation (Doxygen)

We also provide a `Doxyfile` so you can generate full C++ API documentation via Doxygen.

### Prerequisites

- Doxygen (v1.9+ recommended)

### Generating the docs

From your project root:

```
